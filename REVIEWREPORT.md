# Reviewing Extent Reports
After executing the tests, review the Extent Reports with the following steps:
1. Locate the Report:
- Find the
  `test-reports[timeStamp]/test-output/reports/automation-test-report.html` file in 
your project directory, typically in the root or a specified reports' folder.
2. Open the Report:
- Open the
  `test-reports[timeStamp]/test-output/reports/automation-test-report.html` file in a
  web browser to view the test results.
3. Analyzing the Report:
- Check the dashboard summary for overall test statistics.
- Review individual test results for pass/fail status, test logs, and error messages
  if any.
- Look for screenshots or additional information attached to failed tests for
  easier debugging.
  Document any anomalies or failures for further investigation or fixing.
